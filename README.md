[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Pages-blue.svg)](https://stekajack.github.io/pressomancy/)

**Pressomancy** is a Python framework built on top of [EspressoMD](http://espressomd.org/), designed to streamline and abstract the management of objects in molecular simulations. By creating a structured environment for simulation objects, **Pressomancy** enables easy integration, customization, and scalability for complex simulations with minimal setup. 

The framework provides an abstract, modular approach for defining simulation components, ensuring compliance and ease of integration across various objects, such as magnetic filaments, G4 multimers, ligands, and more.

## Features

- **Abstract Framework**: Build and manage simulations with a consistent, object-oriented structure.
- **Custom Simulation Objects**: Create custom simulation objects with compatibility and compliance.
- **Simulation Management**: Centralized, singleton-like simulation class to wrap and control EspressoMD functionality with separate lifetime and memory management.
- **Extendable**: Easily extend the framework with new simulation objects by adhering to the abstract SimulationObject metaclass.
- **Pre-Built Objects**: Includes ready-to-use simulation objects such as magnetic filaments, G4 multimers, and ligands.

## Installation

To install **Pressomancy**, use pip ( -e flag for edit mode):
```bash
pip install pressomancy
```
To test **Pressomancy**, use:
```bash
$path_to_espresso/build/pypresso -m unittest discover -s test
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- EspressoMD

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get started with **Pressomancy**.

1. **Initialize the Simulation**: The `Simulation` class is a singleton-like wrapper for managing an EspressoMD instance with specialised methods to manage a molecular simualation.
2. **Add Simulation Objects**: Add various simulation objects (e.g., magnetic filaments, multimers) that inherit from the `SimulationObject` abstract class, ensuring easy integration and compliance.

```python
from pressomancy import Simulation
from pressomancy.objects import Filament

# Initialize EsoressoMD instace and set system parameters
sim_inst = Simulation(box_dim=(10,10,10))
sim_inst.set_sys()

# Add simulation objects
filaments = [Filament(params=...) for x in range(#)]
# Register objects  in the simulation instance
sim_inst.store_objects(filaments)
# Create objects inside the EspressoMD instance
sim_inst.set_objects(filaments)
# Set interactions
sim_inst.set_vdW(key=('type_key',),lj_eps=#)
# Do work
.
.
.
```
## Usage

**Pressomancy** is designed to be extendable and intuitive, with the aim to simplify and systematise complex architecture creation in molecular simulations. Each component in **Pressomancy** adheres to a standardized interface, making it straightforward to add or modify simulation objects.

### Simulation Class

The `Simulation` class manages the EspressoMD instance and provides methods for simulation management (i.e. I/O, properties), ensuring all objects are added and side effects are synchronized.

```python
from pressomancy import Simulation
sim = Simulation() 
```

### Simulation Objects

Objects in **Pressomancy** use the `SimulationObject` metaclass, ensuring that each object is compliant with the framework's structure. Examples include:
- **Filament**: Represents a linear array of objects.
- **Quadriplex**: Non-canonical DNA conformation.
- **SWPart**: Magnetic nanoparticle with internal anisotropy and magnetodynamis via the tSW model.

`SimulationObject` is implemented to facititate contributors adding their own simualtion object. The metaclass adds various methods, hooks and traps to guarantee compatibility and integration with the **Pressomancy** framework..


```python

from pressomancy.object_classes.object_class import Simulation_Object 
class CustomObject(metaclass=Simulation_Object):
    # all required parameter and methods are attached
    # various traps with detailed debugging info
    # get boolean opeation, iteraton context, destructors
    # the rest is up to you
```

## Modules

- **`objects`**: Library of simulation objects.
- **`resources`**: resources and metadata for objects.
- **`utilities`**: Library of utilities and anaysis routines.
- **`simulation`**: Centralized management of the simulation state.
